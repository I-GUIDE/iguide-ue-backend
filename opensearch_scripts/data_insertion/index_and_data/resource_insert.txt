Near real-time analysis of urban heat enables quick decision-making and timely resource allocation, thereby enhancing the well-being of urban residents, especially during heatwaves or electricity shortages. To serve this purpose, we develop a cyberGIS framework to analyze and visualize human sentiments of heat exposure dynamically based on near real-time location-based social media (LBSM) data. Large volumes and low-cost LBSM data, together with a content analysis algorithm based on natural language processing are used effectively to generate near real-time heat exposure maps from human sentiments on social media at both city and national scales with km spatial resolution and census tract spatial unit. We conducted a case study to visualize and analyze human sentiments of heat exposure in Chicago and the United States in September 2021. Enabled with high-performance computing, dynamic visualization of heat exposure is achieved with fine spatiotemporal scales while heat exposure detected from social media data can be used to understand heat exposure from a human perspective and allow timely responses to extreme heat.", "related-notebooks": ["nb1", "nb2", "nb3", "nb4"], "related-datasets": [], "related-publications": [], "related-oer": [], "external-link": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2024.2343063", "thumbnail-image": "/images/publication_images/pb1.png", "featured": true }
