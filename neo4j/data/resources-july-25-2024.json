    "contents": "Understanding urban heat exposure dynamics is critical for public health, urban management, and climate change resilience. Near real-time analysis of urban heat enables quick decision-making and timely resource allocation, thereby enhancing the well-being of urban residents, especially during heatwaves or electricity shortages. To serve this purpose, we develop a cyberGIS framework to analyze and visualize human sentiments of heat exposure dynamically based on near real-time location-based social media (LBSM) data. Large volumes and low-cost LBSM data, together with a content analysis algorithm based on natural language processing are used effectively to generate near real-time heat exposure maps from human sentiments on social media at both city and national scales with km spatial resolution and census tract spatial unit. We conducted a case study to visualize and analyze human sentiments of heat exposure in Chicago and the United States in September 2021. Enabled with high-performance computing, dynamic visualization of heat exposure is achieved with fine spatiotemporal scales while heat exposure detected from social media data can be used to understand heat exposure from a human perspective and allow timely responses to extreme heat.",

    "contents": "Travel-time computation with large transportation networks is often computationally intensive for two main reasons: 1) large computer memory is required to handle large networks; and 2) calculating shortest-distance paths over large networks is computing intensive. Therefore, previous research tends to limit their spatial extent to reduce computational intensity or resolve computational intensity with advanced cyberinfrastructure. In this context, this article describes a new Spatial Partitioning Algorithm for Scalable Travel-time Computation (SPASTC) that is designed based on spatial domain decomposition with computer memory limit explicitly considered. SPASTC preserves spatial relationships required for travel-time computation and respects a user-specified memory limit, which allows efficient and large-scale travel-time computation within the given memory limit. We demonstrate SPASTC by computing spatial accessibility to hospital beds across the conterminous United States. Our case study shows that SPASTC achieves significant efficiency and scalability making the travel-time computation tens of times faster.",

Calculating travel-time catchments over large spatial extents is com- putationally intensive, with previous work limiting their spatial extent to mini- mize computational burden or overcoming the computational burden with advanced cyberinfrastructure. SPASTC is designed for domain decomposition of travel-time catchment calculations with a user-provided memory limit on computation. SPASTC realizes this through spatial partitioning that preserves spatial relationships required to compute travel-time zones and respects a user-provided memory limit. This al- lows users to efficiently calculate travel-time catchments within a given memory limit and represents a significant speed-up over computing each catchment separately. We demonstrate SPASTC by computing spatial accessibility to hospital beds across the conterminous United States. Our case study shows that SPASTC achieves signifi- cant efficiency and scalability making the computation of travel-time catchment up to 51 times faster.",

    "contents": "A challenge in computational Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is the amount of time and resources required to tune a set of parameters for reproducing the observed patterns of phenomena being modeled. Well-tuned parameters are necessary for models to reproduce real-world multi-scale space-time patterns, but calibration is often computationally intensive and time consuming. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that has found wide use for complex optimization including nonconvex and noisy problems. In this study, we propose to use PSO for calibrating parameters in ABMs. We use a spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission based in Miami, Florida, USA as a case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard implementation of PSO can be used out-of-the-box to successfully calibrate models and out-performs Monte Carlo in terms of optimization and efficiency. ",

The algorithm began as a simulation of social flocking behaviors like those exhibited by flocks of birds and schools of fish, specifically of birds searching a cornfield, but was found to be useful for training feedforward multilayer pernceptron neural networks. Since then, PSO has been adapted in a variety of ways and applied to problems including wireless-sensor networks, classifying biological data, scheduling workflow applications in cloud computing environments, Image classification and power systems.

    "contents": "Geospatial topological relation extraction (GeoTopoRE) aims to extract topological relations between named geospatial entities (i.e., geo-entities) in text. It is a domain-specific relation extraction (RE) task essential in geospatial knowledge graph construction and spatial reasoning. Unlike general-purpose RE, which primarily depends on semantic and syntactic cues, GeoTopoRE requires integrating geometric knowledge about geo-entities. This is essential for accurately capturing or inferring the complex geospatial relationships among entities. GeoTopoRE is not studied systematically and lacks dedicated datasets for evaluation, posing significant challenges to developing and assessing effective models. This study presents two major contributions: (i) the introduction of a high-quality, human-labeled dataset WikiTopo for the GeoTopoRE task, and (ii) a novel framework GeoWISE designed to adapt existing RE models to the GeoTopoRE task, with integrated semantic and external geospatial domain knowledge. We leverage coarse-to-fine-grained natural language inference (NLI) to align externally sourced knowledge with the semantic text context, enhanced by geospatial expertise. This integrated knowledge is then conveyed to language models as geospatial cues, enabling a nuanced understanding of topological relations. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in few-shot settings, showing significant and consistent improvements in the GeoTopoRE task for diverse state-of-the-art RE models.",

Once a problem is decomposed into smaller components, and the component solutions are provided, the idea of abstractions helps to tie the pieces together to express solutions to solve larger problems. For example, modeling a watershed for a flood management system is a computational problem that takes into account many types of data, including terrain, land use, and soil, as well as data from rain gauges and the position and setting of dams, gates, and pumps, all to determine water levels and flows at any given point in the watershed.",

We define cyberliteracy for GIScience (cyberGIScience literacy) and outline eight core areas that serve as a framework for establishing the essential abilities and foundational knowledge necessary to navigate and thrive in this new technologically rich world. The core areas are arranged to provide multiple dimensions of learning ranging from a technological focus to a problem solving focus or a focus on GIScience or computational science. We establish a competency matrix as a means of assessing and evaluating levels of cyberGIScience literacy across the eight core areas. We outline plans to catalyze the collaborative development and sharing of instructional materials to embed cyberGIScience literacy in the classroom and begin to realize a cyberliterate citizenry and academe.",

    "contents": "Background: Concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that can be sustained through sport-related and non-sport-related (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, falls, assaults) mechanisms of injury (MOI). Variations in concussion incidence and MOI may be present throughout the four geographic regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, West) of the United States. However, there is limited evidence exploring concussion cause and diagnosis patterns based on geographic region and MOI. These factors have implications for better understanding the burden of concussion and necessary efforts that can translate to the mitigation of safety concerns. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of sport-related concussion (SRC) and non-sport-related concussion (NSRC) across the four geographic regions of the United States. Methods: A descriptive epidemiology study of patient visits to the emergency department (ED) for concussion between 2010 and 2018, using publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) was conducted. The exposure of interest was geographic region while the main outcome measures were concussion diagnosis and MOI. Descriptive statistics were calculated using population-weighted frequencies and percentages. The association between geographic region and MOI (SRC vs. NSRC) was analyzed using logistic regression models. Odds ratios (OR) presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were included. Univariate analyses were conducted followed by multivariable analyses adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and primary source of payment. Statistical significance was set a priori at p < 0.05 for all analyses. Results: From 2010 to 2018, 1,161 visits resulted in a concussion diagnosis, representing an estimated 7,111,856 visits nationwide. A greater proportion of concussion diagnoses occurred within EDs in the South (38.2%) followed by the West (25.8%), Midwest (21.4%), and Northeast (14.6%). Compared to the West region, patients visiting the ED in the Midwest (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57–0.98) and Northeast (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.51–0.98) had a lower odds of being diagnosed with a concussion. More patients sustained a NSRC MOI (94.3%) compared to SRC MOI (5.7%). For both mechanisms, the South region had the highest population-weighted frequency of SRC (n = 219,994) and NSRC diagnoses (n = 2,495,753). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses did not reveal statistically significant associations for geographic region and MOI (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings showed that the Midwest and Northeast regions had a lower odds of concussion diagnoses in EDs. Overall, the vast majority of concussions were not sport-related, which has public health implications. These findings improve our understanding of how concussion injuries are being sustained geographically nationwide and help to explain care-seeking patterns for concussion in the ED setting.",

This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population by drawing on a newer collection of input data, and provides a range of estimates for at-risk population and land area. Constructing accurate estimates requires high-quality and methodologically consistent input data, and the LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals, digital elevation model, and spatially-delimited urban classifications. Users can find the paper \"Estimating Population and Urban Areas at Risk of Coastal Hazards, 1990-2015: How data choices matter\" (MacManus, et al. 2021) in order to evaluate selected inputs for modeling Low Elevation Coastal Zones. According to the paper, the following are considered core data sets for the purposes of LECZv3 estimates: Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM), Global Human Settlement (GHSL) Population Grid R2019 and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid R2019a v2, and the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11.

Compared with the dry Southwest, the storm-ridden Gulf region and the sea-level rise exposed East and West Coasts, the GLR may fare relatively favorably due to an abundance of natural resources and projected climate amenities. While the emergence and character of such migration is still uncertain, it is essential that GLR urban communities proactively prepare and plan for such a potential future. Understanding how these shifts might affect residents of GLR communities will be critical for a just and sustainable future and for avoiding exacerbating existing inequalities and climate vulnerabilities. Here we propose new scalable methodologies for inclusive engagement that enable wide-reaching knowledge co-creation (e.g., web-based engagement) that can meet the emergent and diverse challenges communities will face. These methodologies have the potential to not only broaden participation and improve practitioners' understanding of different GLR communities' preferences, but also to anticipate emerging tensions and potential synergies associated with increased population pressures.",

The capabilities and applications of GIS continue to rapidly expand, requiring practitioners to have new skills and competencies, especially in computer science. There is little research, however, about how best to prepare the next generation of GIScientists with adequate computer science skills. This article explores how U.S. geography departments are introducing and developing computer science and programming skills in their geography and GIS degree programs. We review the degree requirements in fifty-five geography departments and discover that forty-four of them offer some kind of GIS programming course. Of the 210 separate degree options identified, however, only 22 require one of these courses for a degree. There is little consistency or emphasis on computer science and programming skills in geography or GIS degrees, despite the immense importance of these components in geography and GIS careers. We propose future research along distinct investigative tracks to build a research-based understanding of the educational interactions among GIS, computer science, programming, and geography.",

In 2015, we estimate that between 750 million and nearly 1.1 billion people worldwide lived in areas at or below 10 meters above sea level (LECZ), with the exact number depending on the elevation and population data sources used. These variations are even more pronounced at more detailed levels, especially when considering finer elevation bands (e.g., at or below 5 meters) or different classifications of urban, quasi-urban, and rural populations. Despite these differences, there is a general consensus that the LECZ is disproportionately populated by urban dwellers and that the urban population in the LECZ has grown more rapidly than urban areas outside the LECZ since 1990.",

We conducted a five-month experiment to continuously measure field LFMC samples, biochemical components of dry matter, and leaf spectroscopic data for two species common in the western U.S., lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt).",

    "contents": "Globe-LFMC 2.0, an updated version of Globe-LFMC, is a comprehensive dataset of over 280,000 Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) measurements. These measurements were gathered through field campaigns conducted in 15 countries spanning 47 years. In contrast to its prior version, Globe-LFMC 2.0 incorporates over 120,000 additional data entries, introduces more than 800 new sampling sites, and comprises LFMC values obtained from samples collected until the calendar year 2023. Each entry within the dataset provides essential information, including date, geographical coordinates, plant species, functional type, and, where available, topographical details. Moreover, the dataset encompasses insights into the sampling and weighing procedures, as well as information about land cover type and meteorological conditions at the time and location of each sampling event. Globe-LFMC 2.0 can facilitate advanced LFMC research, supporting studies on wildfire behaviour, physiological traits, ecological dynamics, and land surface modelling, whether remote sensing-based or otherwise. This dataset represents a valuable resource for researchers exploring the diverse LFMC aspects, contributing to the broader field of environmental and ecological research.",

Users should understand the impacts that data representations may have on their results in order to prevent distortions in their outcomes. We study the consequences of two common data preparations when locating a linear feature performing shortest path analysis on raster terrain data: 1) the connectivity of the network generated by connecting raster cells to their neighbors, and 2) the range of the attribute scale for assigning costs. Such analysis is commonly used to locate transmission lines, where the results could have major implications on project cost and its environmental impact. Experiments in solving biobjective shortest paths show that results are highly dependent on the parameters of the data representations, with exceedingly variable results based on the choices made in reclassifying attributes and generating networks from the raster. Based on these outcomes, we outline recommendations for ensuring geographic information system (GIS) data representations maintain analysis results that are accurate and unbiased.",

This study aimed to evaluate how regional and seasonal precipitation and drought patterns had changed in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin between 1983 and 2020 with PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data. The spatial pattern of winter drought, monsoon drought, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated for different time scales were evaluated using principal component analysis. Ganga–Brahmaputra is one of the most populated river basins that flows through different geographical regions. Rain gauges are heterogeneously distributed in the basin due to its complex orography, highlighting the significance of gridded precipitation products over gauge observations for climate studies. Annual and monthly precipitation trends between 1983 and 2020 were evaluated using the original and modified Mann–Kendall trend test, and annual precipitation in the basin was found to be declining at a rate of 5.8 mm/year. An increasing trend was observed in pre-monsoon rainfall, whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend for other months. Results of the Pettitt test showed precipitation time series was inhomogeneous and changepoint occurred around 2000. Decreasing trends of SPI indicated increasing frequency and intensity of drought events. Winter drought showed a clear spatial pattern in the basin; however, SPIs calculated for different time scales and monsoon drought had complex spatial patterns. This study demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data in climate research in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin.",

At present, comprehensive, long-term spatial-temporal flood exposure research in the United States is lacking. The objective of the study is to evaluate county-wide flood exposure in the US and unravel its spatial-temporal dynamics from 2001 to 2019 to answer three research questions via hypothesis testing. First, how have human settlement areas exposed to flood threats in the US changed over the past two decades? Second, has the occurrence of floods and their resulting damage influenced the growth of developed areas in flood zones? Third, do disparities exist in the sensitivity to flood threats among urban-rural communities? Results show that the overall rate of development in flood zones in the contiguous United States has steadily decreased from 2001 to 2019. The Local Moran's I analysis discovers pockets of emerging, expanding, shrinking, and changing clusters of communities that show a rapid increase or decrease of developed areas within flood zones over time. Most counties that experienced more frequent flooding events demonstrate greater responsiveness to flood hazards by avoiding development in flood zones. Finally, urban communities exhibit a higher exposure and sensitivity to flood hazards compared to rural areas.",

To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.",

The rates of land subsidence and sea level rise are aligned to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Reference Frame 2020 (GOM20), which is tied to the stable portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain. GOM20 provides a robust reference for ruling out regional ground movements \nassociated with regional tectonics and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and highlighting natural \nsubsidence in the Gulf Coast Aquifer region. According to this study, the mean sea level rise rate \nwithin the GOM was 2.6 mm=year with respect to GOM20 from the 1970s to the 2010s. Present land \nsubsidence along the Texas coast is dominated by the natural subsidence varying from 0.7 mm=year in \nthe central coastal area (Port Mansfield, Corpus Christi, and Rockport) to 1.6 mm=year in the \nsouthern coastal area (South Padre Island) to 1.5–3.5 mm=year in the northern coastal area \n(Freeport, Galveston Island, Texas City, and Sabine Pass). The average natural subsidence rate \nalong the 600-km Texas coastline is 1.4 mm=year with respect to GOM20. Four scenarios (lowest, \nmedium-low, medium-high, and highest) for future coastal submer- gence were developed by \nintegrating the natural subsidence and sea level rise along the Texas coast with the global sea \nlevel scenarios. Our analysis projects that the average submergence along the Texas coastline from \n2020 to 2100 will be greater than 0.3 m, and likely between 0.6 and\n1.2 m, but is unlikely to exceed 2.0 m.",

GOM20 provides a robust reference for ruling out regional ground movements \nassociated with regional tectonics and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and highlighting natural \nsubsidence in the Gulf Coast Aquifer region. According to this study, the mean sea level rise rate \nwithin the GOM was 2.6 mm=year with respect to GOM20 from the 1970s to the 2010s. Present land \nsubsidence along the Texas coast is dominated by the natural subsidence varying from 0.7 mm=year in \nthe central coastal area (Port Mansfield, Corpus Christi, and Rockport) to 1.6 mm=year in the \nsouthern coastal area (South Padre Island) to 1.5–3.5 mm=year in the northern coastal area \n(Freeport, Galveston Island, Texas City, and Sabine Pass). The average natural subsidence rate \nalong the 600-km Texas coastline is 1.4 mm=year with respect to GOM20. Four scenarios (lowest, \nmedium-low, medium-high, and highest) for future coastal submer- gence were developed by \nintegrating the natural subsidence and sea level rise along the Texas coast with the global sea \nlevel scenarios. Our analysis projects that the average submergence along the Texas coastline from \n2020 to 2100 will be greater than 0.3 m, and likely between 0.6 and\n1.2 m, but is unlikely to exceed 2.0 m.",

The present study carried out a land cover classification using multitemporal RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images that are 24 days apart. The objectives of this study were 1) examining the land cover classification capacity of multitemporal fully PolSAR data processed with multiple polarimetric decomposition methods, 2) investigating the contribution of multi-type polarimetric decomposition methods to multitemporal PolSAR image classification, 3) and determining optimal image acquisition dates and polarimetric parameters for land cover classification. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient attained using the multitemporal PolSAR data were 96.55% and 0.96, respectively, which were improved by as much as 16.77% and 0.20, respectively, compared with those obtained with a single scene. Compared with the multitemporal PolSAR image classification using coherency matrices alone, the use of polarimetric decomposition methods improved overall accuracy and kappa value by 2.22% and 0.03, respectively. Using decision tree algorithms for feature selection, we found that April 14, May 8, June 1, and June 25 and Pauli, Cloude, Neumann3, An&Yang4, Freeman3, Barnes2, and MCSM5 decomposition methods were optimal for the land cover classification.",

    "contents": "Grazing exclusion by fencing (GEF) has been implemented to prevent the deterioration of grassland ecosystems in China since the beginning of this century; meanwhile, the effects have attracted widespread attention from the academic community. However, due to the simultaneity of different factors, it is difficult to separate the effect of different policies from natural resource endowments and identify the independent role of each policy. In this study, a novel framework was established based on spatiotemporal statistics. First, an indicator-denoted vegetation restoration potential achievement degree (VRPAD) was introduced to lessen the impact of resource endowment conditions. Second, a double-difference model of both space and time was developed to reflect the net improvement of VRPAD brought by GEF. The case study showed that 15 out of the 17 fenced-off enclosures achieved positive VRPAD growth since the GEF implementation, while only 58.8% showed a much faster improvement or a slower degeneration than their adjacent areas. It was also found GEF effect presented apparent administrative differences in terms of spatial distribution. The number of effective fences accounted for 75% in Mami Town, but it was 0 in Chabu Town. It is concluded that the role of GEF may be overestimated, multi-pronged approaches are more conducive to vegetation restoration, and strengthening grassroots management and self-policing of fences is important to improve GEF efficiency. This research provides a novel framework for distinguishing policy effect and is expected to inspire new ideas and methodological support for policy formulation and evaluation.",

The aim of this research is threefold: (a) to map coastal protection at the national level; (b) to assess the congruence between the regional and national coastal protection estimates; and (c) to qualitatively assess the congruence of our findings with subnational estimates. We assessed coastal protection capacity, exposure, and demand and adapted them for the coastal zone of Greece. We quantitatively compared our findings with the results of the EU model. Through visual interpretation, we compared national estimates with those for the coastal zone of Peloponnese. Most islands have lower protection capacity than the mainland areas, while the southern part of the country’s coastal zone is the most exposed to natural hazards. Higher coastal protection demand was detected in the country’s largest cities (Athens, Thessaloniki). Areas of attention for management were small and medium islands and urban centres, as they mostly revealed high demand and exposure but the lowest natural capacity. The differences observed in the modelling outputs across scales are attributed to the differences in the demarcation process of the coastal zone, the additional variables considered, the terminology used, and the experts involved. Such national adaptations should be considered in order to build or update EU-wide indicators for coastal protection and beyond, towards a rule-based rather than a one-size-fits-all methodology.",

Near real-time analysis of urban heat enables quick decision-making and timely resource allocation, thereby enhancing the well-being of urban residents, especially during heatwaves or electricity shortages. To serve this purpose, we develop a cyberGIS framework to analyze and visualize human sentiments of heat exposure dynamically based on near real-time location-based social media (LBSM) data. Large volumes and low-cost LBSM data, together with a content analysis algorithm based on natural language processing are used effectively to generate near real-time heat exposure maps from human sentiments on social media at both city and national scales with km spatial resolution and census tract spatial unit. We conducted a case study to visualize and analyze human sentiments of heat exposure in Chicago and the United States in September 2021. Enabled with high-performance computing, dynamic visualization of heat exposure is achieved with fine spatiotemporal scales while heat exposure detected from social media data can be used to understand heat exposure from a human perspective and allow timely responses to extreme heat.",

Therefore, previous research tends to limit their spatial extent to reduce computational intensity or resolve computational intensity with advanced cyberinfrastructure. In this context, this article describes a new Spatial Partitioning Algorithm for Scalable Travel-time Computation (SPASTC) that is designed based on spatial domain decomposition with computer memory limit explicitly considered. SPASTC preserves spatial relationships required for travel-time computation and respects a user-specified memory limit, which allows efficient and large-scale travel-time computation within the given memory limit. We demonstrate SPASTC by computing spatial accessibility to hospital beds across the conterminous United States. Our case study shows that SPASTC achieves significant efficiency and scalability making the travel-time computation tens of times faster.",

Calculating travel-time catchments over large spatial extents is com- putationally intensive, with previous work limiting their spatial extent to mini- mize computational burden or overcoming the computational burden with advanced cyberinfrastructure. SPASTC is designed for domain decomposition of travel-time catchment calculations with a user-provided memory limit on computation. SPASTC realizes this through spatial partitioning that preserves spatial relationships required to compute travel-time zones and respects a user-provided memory limit. This al- lows users to efficiently calculate travel-time catchments within a given memory limit and represents a significant speed-up over computing each catchment separately. We demonstrate SPASTC by computing spatial accessibility to hospital beds across the conterminous United States.

    "contents": "A challenge in computational Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is the amount of time and resources required to tune a set of parameters for reproducing the observed patterns of phenomena being modeled. Well-tuned parameters are necessary for models to reproduce real-world multi-scale space-time patterns, but calibration is often computationally intensive and time consuming. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that has found wide use for complex optimization including nonconvex and noisy problems. In this study, we propose to use PSO for calibrating parameters in ABMs. We use a spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission based in Miami, Florida, USA as a case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard implementation of PSO can be used out-of-the-box to successfully calibrate models and out-performs Monte Carlo in terms of optimization and efficiency. ",

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was first introduced in 1995 by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart. The algorithm began as a simulation of social flocking behaviors like those exhibited by flocks of birds and schools of fish, specifically of birds searching a cornfield, but was found to be useful for training feedforward multilayer pernceptron neural networks. Since then, PSO has been adapted in a variety of ways and applied to problems including wireless-sensor networks, classifying biological data, scheduling workflow applications in cloud computing environments, Image classification and power systems. In this notebook we explore PSO's usefulness for calibration, with a focus on spatially-explicit agent-based models (ABMs). Publication: https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4796",

    "contents": "Geospatial topological relation extraction (GeoTopoRE) aims to extract topological relations between named geospatial entities (i.e., geo-entities) in text. It is a domain-specific relation extraction (RE) task essential in geospatial knowledge graph construction and spatial reasoning. Unlike general-purpose RE, which primarily depends on semantic and syntactic cues, GeoTopoRE requires integrating geometric knowledge about geo-entities. This is essential for accurately capturing or inferring the complex geospatial relationships among entities. GeoTopoRE is not studied systematically and lacks dedicated datasets for evaluation, posing significant challenges to developing and assessing effective models. This study presents two major contributions: (i) the introduction of a high-quality, human-labeled dataset WikiTopo for the GeoTopoRE task, and (ii) a novel framework GeoWISE designed to adapt existing RE models to the GeoTopoRE task, with integrated semantic and external geospatial domain knowledge. We leverage coarse-to-fine-grained natural language inference (NLI) to align externally sourced knowledge with the semantic text context, enhanced by geospatial expertise. This integrated knowledge is then conveyed to language models as geospatial cues, enabling a nuanced understanding of topological relations. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in few-shot settings, showing significant and consistent improvements in the GeoTopoRE task for diverse state-of-the-art RE models.",

Once a problem is decomposed into smaller components, and the component solutions are provided, the idea of abstractions helps to tie the pieces together to express solutions to solve larger problems. For example, modeling a watershed for a flood management system is a computational problem that takes into account many types of data, including terrain, land use, and soil, as well as data from rain gauges and the position and setting of dams, gates, and pumps, all to determine water levels and flows at any given point in the watershed.",

We define cyberliteracy for GIScience (cyberGIScience literacy) and outline eight core areas that serve as a framework for establishing the essential abilities and foundational knowledge necessary to navigate and thrive in this new technologically rich world. The core areas are arranged to provide multiple dimensions of learning ranging from a technological focus to a problem solving focus or a focus on GIScience or computational science. We establish a competency matrix as a means of assessing and evaluating levels of cyberGIScience literacy across the eight core areas. We outline plans to catalyze the collaborative development and sharing of instructional materials to embed cyberGIScience literacy in the classroom and begin to realize a cyberliterate citizenry and academe.",

    "contents": "Background: Concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that can be sustained through sport-related and non-sport-related (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, falls, assaults) mechanisms of injury (MOI). Variations in concussion incidence and MOI may be present throughout the four geographic regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, West) of the United States. However, there is limited evidence exploring concussion cause and diagnosis patterns based on geographic region and MOI. These factors have implications for better understanding the burden of concussion and necessary efforts that can translate to the mitigation of safety concerns. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of sport-related concussion (SRC) and non-sport-related concussion (NSRC) across the four geographic regions of the United States. Methods: A descriptive epidemiology study of patient visits to the emergency department (ED) for concussion between 2010 and 2018, using publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) was conducted. The exposure of interest was geographic region while the main outcome measures were concussion diagnosis and MOI. Descriptive statistics were calculated using population-weighted frequencies and percentages. The association between geographic region and MOI (SRC vs. NSRC) was analyzed using logistic regression models. Odds ratios (OR) presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were included. Univariate analyses were conducted followed by multivariable analyses adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and primary source of payment. Statistical significance was set a priori at p < 0.05 for all analyses. Results: From 2010 to 2018, 1,161 visits resulted in a concussion diagnosis, representing an estimated 7,111,856 visits nationwide. A greater proportion of concussion diagnoses occurred within EDs in the South (38.2%) followed by the West (25.8%), Midwest (21.4%), and Northeast (14.6%). Compared to the West region, patients visiting the ED in the Midwest (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57–0.98) and Northeast (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.51–0.98) had a lower odds of being diagnosed with a concussion. More patients sustained a NSRC MOI (94.3%) compared to SRC MOI (5.7%). For both mechanisms, the South region had the highest population-weighted frequency of SRC (n = 219,994) and NSRC diagnoses (n = 2,495,753). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses did not reveal statistically significant associations for geographic region and MOI (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings showed that the Midwest and Northeast regions had a lower odds of concussion diagnoses in EDs. Overall, the vast majority of concussions were not sport-related, which has public health implications. These findings improve our understanding of how concussion injuries are being sustained geographically nationwide and help to explain care-seeking patterns for concussion in the ED setting.",

This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population by drawing on a newer collection of input data, and provides a range of estimates for at-risk population and land area. Constructing accurate estimates requires high-quality and methodologically consistent input data, and the LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals, digital elevation model, and spatially-delimited urban classifications. Users can find the paper \"Estimating Population and Urban Areas at Risk of Coastal Hazards, 1990-2015: How data choices matter\" (MacManus, et al. 2021) in order to evaluate selected inputs for modeling Low Elevation Coastal Zones. According to the paper, the following are considered core data sets for the purposes of LECZv3 estimates: Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM), Global Human Settlement (GHSL) Population Grid R2019 and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid R2019a v2, and the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11.

Compared with the dry Southwest, the storm-ridden Gulf region and the sea-level rise exposed East and West Coasts, the GLR may fare relatively favorably due to an abundance of natural resources and projected climate amenities. While the emergence and character of such migration is still uncertain, it is essential that GLR urban communities proactively prepare and plan for such a potential future. Understanding how these shifts might affect residents of GLR communities will be critical for a just and sustainable future and for avoiding exacerbating existing inequalities and climate vulnerabilities. Here we propose new scalable methodologies for inclusive engagement that enable wide-reaching knowledge co-creation (e.g., web-based engagement) that can meet the emergent and diverse challenges communities will face. These methodologies have the potential to not only broaden participation and improve practitioners' understanding of different GLR communities' preferences, but also to anticipate emerging tensions and potential synergies associated with increased population pressures.",

The capabilities and applications of GIS continue to rapidly expand, requiring practitioners to have new skills and competencies, especially in computer science. There is little research, however, about how best to prepare the next generation of GIScientists with adequate computer science skills. This article explores how U.S. geography departments are introducing and developing computer science and programming skills in their geography and GIS degree programs. We review the degree requirements in fifty-five geography departments and discover that forty-four of them offer some kind of GIS programming course. Of the 210 separate degree options identified, however, only 22 require one of these courses for a degree. There is little consistency or emphasis on computer science and programming skills in geography or GIS degrees, despite the immense importance of these components in geography and GIS careers. We propose future research along distinct investigative tracks to build a research-based understanding of the educational interactions among GIS, computer science, programming, and geography.",

In 2015, we estimate that between 750 million and nearly 1.1 billion people worldwide lived in areas at or below 10 meters above sea level (LECZ), with the exact number depending on the elevation and population data sources used. These variations are even more pronounced at more detailed levels, especially when considering finer elevation bands (e.g., at or below 5 meters) or different classifications of urban, quasi-urban, and rural populations. Despite these differences, there is a general consensus that the LECZ is disproportionately populated by urban dwellers and that the urban population in the LECZ has grown more rapidly than urban areas outside the LECZ since 1990.",

We conducted a five-month experiment to continuously measure field LFMC samples, biochemical components of dry matter, and leaf spectroscopic data for two species common in the western U.S., lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt).",

Users should understand the impacts that data representations may have on their results in order to prevent distortions in their outcomes. We study the consequences of two common data preparations when locating a linear feature performing shortest path analysis on raster terrain data: 1) the connectivity of the network generated by connecting raster cells to their neighbors, and 2) the range of the attribute scale for assigning costs. Such analysis is commonly used to locate transmission lines, where the results could have major implications on project cost and its environmental impact. Experiments in solving biobjective shortest paths show that results are highly dependent on the parameters of the data representations, with exceedingly variable results based on the choices made in reclassifying attributes and generating networks from the raster. Based on these outcomes, we outline recommendations for ensuring geographic information system (GIS) data representations maintain analysis results that are accurate and unbiased.",

This study aimed to evaluate how regional and seasonal precipitation and drought patterns had changed in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin between 1983 and 2020 with PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data. The spatial pattern of winter drought, monsoon drought, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated for different time scales were evaluated using principal component analysis. Ganga–Brahmaputra is one of the most populated river basins that flows through different geographical regions. Rain gauges are heterogeneously distributed in the basin due to its complex orography, highlighting the significance of gridded precipitation products over gauge observations for climate studies. Annual and monthly precipitation trends between 1983 and 2020 were evaluated using the original and modified Mann–Kendall trend test, and annual precipitation in the basin was found to be declining at a rate of 5.8 mm/year. An increasing trend was observed in pre-monsoon rainfall, whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend for other months. Results of the Pettitt test showed precipitation time series was inhomogeneous and changepoint occurred around 2000. Decreasing trends of SPI indicated increasing frequency and intensity of drought events. Winter drought showed a clear spatial pattern in the basin; however, SPIs calculated for different time scales and monsoon drought had complex spatial patterns. This study demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data in climate research in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin.",

At present, comprehensive, long-term spatial-temporal flood exposure research in the United States is lacking. The objective of the study is to evaluate county-wide flood exposure in the US and unravel its spatial-temporal dynamics from 2001 to 2019 to answer three research questions via hypothesis testing. First, how have human settlement areas exposed to flood threats in the US changed over the past two decades? Second, has the occurrence of floods and their resulting damage influenced the growth of developed areas in flood zones? Third, do disparities exist in the sensitivity to flood threats among urban-rural communities? Results show that the overall rate of development in flood zones in the contiguous United States has steadily decreased from 2001 to 2019. The Local Moran's I analysis discovers pockets of emerging, expanding, shrinking, and changing clusters of communities that show a rapid increase or decrease of developed areas within flood zones over time. Most counties that experienced more frequent flooding events demonstrate greater responsiveness to flood hazards by avoiding development in flood zones. Finally, urban communities exhibit a higher exposure and sensitivity to flood hazards compared to rural areas.",

    "contents": "Fitness apps, such as Strava, are a growing source of data for mapping bicycling ridership, due to large samples and high resolution. To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.",

The objectives of this study were 1) examining the land cover classification capacity of multitemporal fully PolSAR data processed with multiple polarimetric decomposition methods, 2) investigating the contribution of multi-type polarimetric decomposition methods to multitemporal PolSAR image classification, 3) and determining optimal image acquisition dates and polarimetric parameters for land cover classification. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient attained using the multitemporal PolSAR data were 96.55% and 0.96, respectively, which were improved by as much as 16.77% and 0.20, respectively, compared with those obtained with a single scene. Compared with the multitemporal PolSAR image classification using coherency matrices alone, the use of polarimetric decomposition methods improved overall accuracy and kappa value by 2.22% and 0.03, respectively. Using decision tree algorithms for feature selection, we found that April 14, May 8, June 1, and June 25 and Pauli, Cloude, Neumann3, An&Yang4, Freeman3, Barnes2, and MCSM5 decomposition methods were optimal for the land cover classification.",

However, due to the simultaneity of different factors, it is difficult to separate the effect of different policies from natural resource endowments and identify the independent role of each policy. In this study, a novel framework was established based on spatiotemporal statistics. First, an indicator-denoted vegetation restoration potential achievement degree (VRPAD) was introduced to lessen the impact of resource endowment conditions. Second, a double-difference model of both space and time was developed to reflect the net improvement of VRPAD brought by GEF. The case study showed that 15 out of the 17 fenced-off enclosures achieved positive VRPAD growth since the GEF implementation, while only 58.8% showed a much faster improvement or a slower degeneration than their adjacent areas. It was also found GEF effect presented apparent administrative differences in terms of spatial distribution. The number of effective fences accounted for 75% in Mami Town, but it was 0 in Chabu Town. It is concluded that the role of GEF may be overestimated, multi-pronged approaches are more conducive to vegetation restoration, and strengthening grassroots management and self-policing of fences is important to improve GEF efficiency. This research provides a novel framework for distinguishing policy effect and is expected to inspire new ideas and methodological support for policy formulation and evaluation.",

The aim of this research is threefold: (a) to map coastal protection at the national level; (b) to assess the congruence between the regional and national coastal protection estimates; and (c) to qualitatively assess the congruence of our findings with subnational estimates. We assessed coastal protection capacity, exposure, and demand and adapted them for the coastal zone of Greece. We quantitatively compared our findings with the results of the EU model. Through visual interpretation, we compared national estimates with those for the coastal zone of Peloponnese. Most islands have lower protection capacity than the mainland areas, while the southern part of the country’s coastal zone is the most exposed to natural hazards. Higher coastal protection demand was detected in the country’s largest cities (Athens, Thessaloniki). Areas of attention for management were small and medium islands and urban centres, as they mostly revealed high demand and exposure but the lowest natural capacity. The differences observed in the modelling outputs across scales are attributed to the differences in the demarcation process of the coastal zone, the additional variables considered, the terminology used, and the experts involved. Such national adaptations should be considered in order to build or update EU-wide indicators for coastal protection and beyond, towards a rule-based rather than a one-size-fits-all methodology.",

In this paper, the author uses the El Paso Water Utilities (EPWU) ASR system for injection of reclaimed wastewater into the Hueco Bolson aquifer as an example to address challenges and resolutions faced …",
