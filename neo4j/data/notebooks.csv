nb5,Who is facing the risk of potential dam failures?,"['Aging-Dams', 'Infrastructure']","This study proposes a framework employing spatial metrics (Bivariate Moran's I and LISA) to discover where and whether socially vulnerable populations are more exposed to flood inundation risks induced by dam failures. This notebook, in particular, demonstrates the socioeconomic characteristics of at-risk populations, focusing on 345 dams in the conterminous United States.",,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/population_vulnerable_to_dam_failure,at-risk populations impacted by the aging dam.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb5.png,True
nb6,Accessing and utilizing IPUMS NHGIS Data using Python API,"['IPUMS', 'API']",This notebook demonstrates uses and functionality of the API interface provided by IPUMS for NHGIS to access and request data in a reproducible and documentable Python workflow.,,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/nhgis_api_workflow,nhgis_api_workflow.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb6.png,false
nb7,Social Media (Twitter) Data Visualization,"['Twitter', 'Visualization', 'Human Sentiments of Heat Exposure']",This notebook provides examples of visualization of social media data including where the location-based Twitter data were posted in the City of Chicago and across the world.,,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,Visualization.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb7.png,false
nb8,City-level Analysis at Chicago,"['City-level Analysis', 'Twitter', 'Human Sentiments of Heat Exposure']",This notebook shows both census tract level and 1â€‰km spatial resolution analysis of human sentiments of heat exposure on 2021-09-25 and 2021-09-26.,,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,City-level Analysis.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb8.png,false
nb9,Social Media Based Socioeconomic Analysis,"['Socioeconomic', 'Twitter', 'Human Sentiments of Heat Exposure']","This notebook combines Twitter data and socioeconomic data, and investigates the relationship between human sentiments of heat exposure and different socioeconomic indicators.",,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,Analysis.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb9.png,false
nb10,Map Projections,"['NAD83', 'WGS84', 'Web Mercator', 'Coordinate System']","Map projections are mathematical models used to transform the curved Earth's surface onto a flat, two-dimensional plane. They are necessary because representing a three-dimensional spherical shape on a flat surface inevitably introduces some form of distortion. Different map projections are designed to preserve or minimize distortion of specific properties like area, shape, distance, or direction, depending on the intended application and geographic region.",,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,Map Projection.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb10.png,false
nb11,Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP),"['MAUP', 'Scale', 'Spatial unit']","The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) is a well-known issue in spatial analysis and geography that arises when aggregating data into different geographic units or scales. It refers to the fact that the results of statistical analyses can vary significantly depending on how the geographic units (e.g., census tracts, zip codes, counties) are defined or delineated.",,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,MAUP.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb11.png,false
nb12,GIS Data Types,"['Vector data', 'Raster data']","In Geographic Information Science (GIS), data types refer to the different ways in which geographic data can be represented and stored. The two main data types in GIS are: Vector Data, which represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons; and Raster Data, which represents geographic information as a grid of cells or pixels, where each cell contains a value.",,https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks-inventory,Data Type.ipynb,/images/notebook_images/nb12.png,false
